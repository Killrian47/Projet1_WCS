# Project 1 Wild Code School

## Our client

Our client is **Superman** !
Superman is searching a new team of super hero to join ! For that he need a online CV.
We proposed him a online CV using differents technologies : 
- HTML5
- CSS3 / SCSS
- JS 
- PHP 8 

## How to install our project 

You just need to run the following command : ``git clone <link-of-repository>``

## Run the project 

To run the project, you'll need PHP version. In order to check if you have got one, you just need to do ``php -v`` or ``php --version``.

If you don't have PHP on your laptop you won't be able to run the project on a local server.

## Run the server to access it on you laptop

If you have a PHP version, tap ``php -S localhost:<the-defined-port(often 80 ou 8000)``.
Now you just have to copy the link on your browser to get the final result of our project ! 

## Run the server on a local network

You can also run the project on a local network by entering ``php 0.0.0.0:<the-defined-port(often 80 ou 8000)>``
To access the server you need to get the **IP** of the computer who runs the server. In order to do so, several commands are avaible depending on your OS.
- Linux -> ``ip address show``
- Windows / Mac -> ``ipconfig``
